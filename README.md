# WebAudioPlugins
The Web Audio API includes a set of unit generators called AudioNodes for graph-based audio DSP algorithms. The standard AudioNodes allow for developing a range of web applications that require audio engines that go beyond simple playback. The recent addition of the AudioWorkletNode provides an efficient way to implement custom low-level processing, significantly increasing the possibilities of this technology. There are many different apps created with the Web Audio API that run independently, however there is no standard way to make them interoperable i.e. take a drum machine developed by X, load it into an application developed by Y and apply audio processing developed by Z. In the native audio world, these interchangeable units are called "audio plug-ins" and applications that can use them are known as "hosts" which are typically DAWs.
